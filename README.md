# TUSK Codespace

This is a template repository which is setup to use the [TUSK](https://github.com/mshafae/tusk) devcontainer.

This means that the GitHub Codespace that's created with this template repository will be identical to the one you used in CPSC 120A/L and CPSC 121A/L at [California State University Fullerton](https://www.fullerton.edu/).
